"""CodeQL SARIF gate — fails the build on any error-severity finding.

sprout is a private repo with no GitHub Advanced Security, so `codeql-action/analyze`
runs with `upload: never` (the code-scanning SARIF-upload API isn't available and would otherwise
fail the job with "Code scanning is not enabled for this repository"). Without upload, nothing else
makes the CodeQL job reflect its own findings — this script reads the SARIF CodeQL writes locally
and fails if any result's rule carries `problem.severity: error` (CodeQL's own severity, surfaced
per-result in `properties.problem.severity` or via the rule's default `level`).

CodeQL emits its rule metadata under `runs[].tool.extensions[].rules`, NOT under
`runs[].tool.driver.rules` (which it leaves empty), and it does not put a `level` on individual
results at all — severity lives on the rule. Resolving rules from the driver alone therefore built
an empty lookup table and made every result unclassifiable, so the gate could not fail on an
error-severity finding even in principle. Rules are now read from the driver AND every extension,
and a rule's `defaultConfiguration.level` counts alongside `properties["problem.severity"]`.

Warning- and note-severity findings are REPORTED but deliberately do NOT affect the exit code.
They used to be invisible: the only line this script printed counted error-severity results, so
"CodeQL: 0 error-severity finding(s)" read as "CodeQL found nothing" when it often meant "CodeQL
found things, none of which this gate is allowed to fail on". The advisory summary below exists so
that distinction is visible in the log. Raising the floor to fail on warnings is a separate,
deliberate decision — it is not made here, and nothing that passes today starts failing.
