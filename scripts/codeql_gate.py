"""CodeQL SARIF gate — fails the build on any error-severity finding.

sprout is a private repo with no GitHub Advanced Security, so `codeql-action/analyze`
runs with `upload: never` (the code-scanning SARIF-upload API isn't available and would otherwise
fail the job with "Code scanning is not enabled for this repository"). Without upload, nothing else
makes the CodeQL job reflect its own findings — this script reads the SARIF CodeQL writes locally
and fails if any result's rule carries `problem.severity: error` (CodeQL's own severity, surfaced
per-result in `properties.problem.severity` or via the rule's default `level`).
